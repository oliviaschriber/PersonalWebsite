    <div class="introduction">
      Hello, there! My name is Olivia Schriber, I'm graduating Washington University in St. Louis in 2023
      with a degree in Systems Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. I want to leave the world a better place than I found it, 
      and inspire and enact change. I'm looking to challenge myself and to chart my own course.

    <div class="caveat">
     A caveat: Hi Expensify. You guys asked for a website, so here it is. I've been in Web Development course 
     for under a month now, so this website is a skeleton. As I learn more, the style of this website will improve. 
     I hope you'll want to stick around to see how I can grow :)
